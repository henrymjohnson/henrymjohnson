## About Me

I wrapped up my masters December 2022, successfully defending my thesis on The Impact of the 2018 Wine Tariffs on Domestic Wine in April. Since May 2022, I've been working as a Quality Assurance Engineer and a researcher at Boise State. 

Research topics I'm interested in:
- The impact of policy changes on social welfare
    - Specifically, tariffs and international trade, on prices and production
- Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation
    - Currently studying Matthew Jackson's Social and Economic Networks textbook and 
- Anything in my daily life that I can try to model and refine
- Why is data so freaking difficult to obtain for most the questions we care about?
    - And how the heck can we weed out causal effects?

Some methods I enjoy:
- Conditional statements (you know, really basic "AI")
- 2SLS
- Time Series (ARIMA, VAR)
- Gravity Models
- k-NN, Clustering, various classification techniques
