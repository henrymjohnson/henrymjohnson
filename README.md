## About Me

Hey there! I'm currently a student at Boise State getting my master's in science in Economics. If I weren't doing this, I'd probably be studying economics and data science while working as a paperhanger or a quality assurance analyst/engineer/sdet/what have you——I'd be doing something focused on providing a high quality product while learning how to improve doing that thing. When I'm not working, I enjoy mountain biking and reading sci-fi, light humor (P. G. Wodehouse, mostly), or books on economic growth and innovation.

Research topics I'm interested in:
- The impact of policy changes on social welfare
    - Specifically, tariffs and international trade, on prices and production
- Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation
- Anything in my daily life that I can try to model and refine
- Why is data so freaking difficult to obtain for the great questions that exist?
    - And how the heck can we weed out causal effects?

Some methods I enjoy:
- Conditional statements (you know, really basic "AI")
- 2SLS
- Gravity Models
- k-NN

In school, I've worked on a few small projects with R (3), a few in python (8), and a couple in stata. I'm working on my thesis (defense tentative for April 2022) in python and submitted research for a competition that was done in stata.

At work, I've mostly worked with TSQL. However, I've used python and postman (with javascript and graphql) to automate workflows for various regression tests.

If you're interested in chatting or collaborating on a project, feel free to email me at hennrymjohnson@gmail.com.

Thanks for stoppping by!
