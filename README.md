## About Me

Wrapped up my grad program in December 2022 with a thesis on The Impact of the 2018 Wine Tariffs on domestic wine.

Research topics I'm interested in:
- The impact of policy changes on social welfare
    - Specifically, tariffs and international trade, on prices and production
- Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation
    - Currently studying Matthew Jackson's Social and Economic Networks textbook
    - Using it for research with Dr. Michail Fragkias in urban science creation using NetworkX
- Anything in my daily life that I can try to model and refine
- Why is data so freaking difficult to obtain for most the questions we care about?
    - And how the heck can we weed out causal effects?
        - Recently wrapped up research using structural causal models (specifically ANMs) in the economic development of the Pearl River Delta Region of China with Fragkias
    - Messy data isn't new; econometricians have been identifying workarounds for awhile
        - See: "Data and Econometriciansâ€”The Uneasy Alliance" by Zvi Griliches (1985) 
    - Currently researching the relationship between patents and GNP with Fragkias and Joshaghani

Some methods I enjoy:
- Time Series (ARIMA, VAR, State Space)
- Gravity Models
- k-NN, Clustering, various classification techniques
- Causal Inference: 2SLS, DID, IV, SCM (Judea Pearl & Jonas Peters)
    - Shout out to Angrist & Pischke's Mostly Harmless Econometrics
